# Peloton API Tool

A tool designed to pull some information from Peloton's public API. This tool requires the user to enter their username, and then we pull through some select information regarding their account. 

This tool currently displays:
- Profile picture
- Username
- Location
- Total workouts
- First tagged team

# Why?

This app was initially created during the Pelothon challenge of 2020, in order to display my team choice!

# Building

This tool was built with create-react-app as it's a single page react component. 

To build locally, ensure you have:
- node
- npm

Then cd into the folder, and run npm start! It will build at a localhost and you will be able to view the site!

# Next Steps

- Provide more data from the public API:
    - Update specific workout amounts
    - Provide streaks 
- Optimise for mobile devices
